This is a lightweight JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision vectors. 
The sourcecode is in the folder Src. Tests of the library are in the folder Test.

The library requires the use of big.js, an arbitrary-precision number library. I (Skyphia) did not make big.js. I made everything else.

This library was hastily made for a homework assignment. If you decide to use it, you may want to further review and test the code.
