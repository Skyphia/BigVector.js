# BigVector.js
A lightweight JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision vectors. 

The library requires the use of big.js, an arbitrary-precision number library which has a separate page on GitHub, but a copy of it is included in this project. 

This library was hastily made for a homework assignment. If you decide to use it, you may want to further review and test the code.
